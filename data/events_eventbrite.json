    "date": "Multiple dates",
    "description": "\"Little Rome\", as they call it. Did you know Trnava earned this monniker for its multitude of medieval churches? More recently, a shipload of fresh ideas initiated by its Denmark-educated mayor transformed the quaint town into one of Slovakia's most interesting and sustainable urban spaces.\nWe first meet at the Social Brunch Bratislava before taking an express train to our destination, Trnava. Our casual Old Town stroll will stop by Trnava's main avenue, a 16th-century watchtower (entry optional), a sacral coffee shop and other gems of its rich history. Juxtaposingly, we also detour into a socialist-era residential complex just outside the city walls.\nUnderway we'll have fun with ice breakers, discussion prompts and local trivia. After dinner, our train back follows the stunning silhouette of the Lower Carpathians.\nTotal time: Half day\nLanguage: English\nWear: Seasonal outfit, rain gear depending on weather\nValue and booking\nPrice includes organization, train tickets and friendly host. Discounts available for early birds and groups. Admission to the\nSocial Brunch Bratislava\nincluded too. Food & drinks are at your own expense.",

Join\n4\nseasoned\nLevel 2\nKAP facilitators, for a weekend\nimmersion\ndesigned to guide you on an\nextraordinary\njourney of self-discovery and transformation through\nKundalini\nand\nNondual Awareness\nTransmissions.\nAwakening the Kundalini:\nThe Energy of Transformation\nThe\ntransmission\nof KAP is different from wilful kundalini practices and goes beyond just kundalini. It’s a descending life force where the energy enters from the crown and works its way towards the root chakra where it activates the kundalini, and starts to flow both ways. In a session, you lie on a yoga mat, music is played and facilitators may touch some of the meridian points on your body. All that’s required of you is to surrender to the process. No previous experience is necessary.\nNondual Transmissions:\nRealizing the Unity of Existence\nNonduality is the recognition that the boundaries between self and other, mind and world, are illusory. Through direct nondual transmissions, you will be guided to experience the fundamental unity of all things. This transmission can help you dissolve the egoic barriers and reveal the seamless nature of consciousness.

It’s a descending life force where the energy enters from the crown and works its way towards the root chakra where it activates the kundalini, and starts to flow both ways. In a session, you lie on a yoga mat, music is played and facilitators may touch some of the meridian points on your body. All that’s required of you is to surrender to the process. No previous experience is necessary.\nNondual Transmissions:\nRealizing the Unity of Existence\nNonduality is the recognition that the boundaries between self and other, mind and world, are illusory. Through direct nondual transmissions, you will be guided to experience the fundamental unity of all things. This transmission can help you dissolve the egoic barriers and reveal the seamless nature of consciousness.

    "title": "Load Adaptation - Train Smarter and Harder (Bratislava)",
    "date": "Saturday, October 25",
    "description": "This two-day workshop bridges the gap between theory and practice. Participants will gain hands-on experience monitoring training loads, designing session and weekly training plans, and providing training programs to meet the individual needs of athletes and patients. The workshop is presented in a small group setting, promoting interaction and discussion amongst participants, and allowing ample time for Q&A. Whether you are an experienced practitioner or simply want to gain some practical ideas to implement in your clinic, this workshop will help you to “build a training program from the ground up”!\nLearning Objectives and Goals:\nUpon successful completion of this course, the practitioner will:\n* Understand the difference between acute and chronic workloads.\n* Demonstrate the importance of high chronic workloads in protecting against injury.\n* Understand how to calculate and apply the acute:chronic workload ratio to safely progress athlete workloads.\n* Gain an understanding of the factors that protect against \"spikes\" in workload.\n* Develop return to train, play, and 'compete' plans.\n* Understand how to identify the 'worst-case scenario' and prepare players for these demands.\n* Understand how to individualize aerobic training programs.\nProgram Description\nDay 1\n(8:30am-9:00am): Participants registration\n(9:00am-9:30am): Coaching Roundtable – What is “Load Management” Really About?\nThis session will provide practitioners the opportunity to discuss the concepts around load management, and what it means for their practice. (Group Interaction)\n(9:30am-10:30am): Towards a Best Practice Approach to Load Monitoring (part 1)\nIn this session the most recent work on training monitoring (and current controversies) will be discussed. (Lecture)\n(10:30am-10:45am): Break\n(10:45am-12:00pm): Towards a Best Practice Approach to Load Monitoring (part 2)\nIn this session the most recent work on training monitoring (and current controversies) will be discussed. (Lecture)\n(12:00pm-1:00pm): Monitoring with Minimal Resources\nIn this session, Tim will demonstrate how coaches can monitor their athletes’ training - even when they have minimal resources at their disposal. (Group Interaction)\n(1:00pm-2:00pm): Lunch break\n(2.00pm-3.00pm): Putting Training Monitoring into Practice\nBring your laptops and tablets along! In this session, participants will use techniques learned from the preceding sessions to write their own programs. (Practical)\n(3:00pm-3:15pm): Break\n(3.15pm-4.30pm): Training Smarter and Harder\nThis session will highlight the latest evidence demonstrating that training harder is actually training smarter! (Lecture)\n(4:30pm-5:00pm): Open Forum and Discussion\n(Group Discussion)\nDay 2\n(9:00am-9:45am): Making a Difference in High Performance Sport\nThis session will discuss ways in which coaches, athletic trainers, strength and conditioning staff and sport science researchers can develop an integrated program using an athlete-centered approach. (Lecture)\n(9:45am-10:45am): Load Monitoring – It’s Not All About the “Ratio”!\nIn this session the most recent work on training monitoring will be discussed. Appropriately staged training (rather than simply monitoring) and its role in managing injury and pain will be explored. (Lecture)\n(10:45am-11:00am): Break\n(11:00am-12:45pm): Developing Load Capacity in Adolescent Athletes\nThis session requires participants to work together to find ways to develop load capacity in adolescent athletes preparing to compete against elite senior international athletes.

Popri klientskej práci sa venujem odovzdávaniu vedomostí ako školiteľ UX a metódy Design Thinking.\n💬 Keď je aj design thinking prikrátky\nPodelím sa s Vami o 3 krátke príbehy z mojej praxe. Predstavím Vám moje skúsenosti s rapid prototyping-om, dizajnovým šprintom a v neposlednom rade vám porozprávam o nezdaroch, ktorým sa už nepodarilo zabrániť.\n👤 Katarína Vass – UX výskumníčka @ Off/grid lab, o.z.\nSom UX výskumníčka, ktorá prepája digitálne technológie s kultúrnym sektorom. Stojím za iniciatívou Off/Grid lab, kde pomáha galériám a múzeám tvoriť zmysluplné digitálne riešenia, ktoré robia umenie prístupným, zrozumiteľným a živým. Verím, že kultúra nemá byť tichým archívom pre vyvolených, ale priestorom pre objavovanie, zvedavosť a interakciu. Popritom vyučujem UX dizajn a výskum na univerzite, kde prepájam študentov s reálnym svetom a výzvami, ktoré majú zmysel aj dopad.\n💬 UX v galérii: príbehy pod palcom\nPodelím sa s vami o prípadovú štúdiu digitálnej aplikácie, ktorá návštevníkom umožňuje objavovať a prehlbovať vzťah k vystaveným dielam cez interaktívne funkcie. Objasním ako sme riešili výzvy s komunikáciou aplikácie priamo v priestoroch galérie a zároveň na základe používateľského výskumu identifikovali pozitívnu pridanú hodnotu, ale aj problémy s preťažením obsahu a navigáciou.\n👤 Mária Kostická – Head of Innovation Development @ Bratislava – hlavné mesto SR\nSom skúsená servis dizajnérka, ktorá už 5 rokov pomáha zlepšovať služby mesta Bratislava. Vyštudovala som Matfyz a momentálne vediem programátorskú časť inovačného tímu a zavádzam princípy design thinkingu naprieč magistrátom s dôrazom na používateľské potreby a zákaznícku skúsenosť.\n💬 Digitálna Bratislava – fakt alebo fikcia?\n(Info doplníme)\n👤 Petra Stejskalová – Grafická dizajnérka\nJsem grafická designérka „ze staré školy“ – z časů, kdy se weby kreslily na papír a řezaly v Photoshopu. Už tehdy jsme řešili estetiku a funkci, ale pojmy jako cílovka, UX nebo výzkum zněly spíš jako z jiné planety. Dnes se věnuji komplexním vizuálním řešením pro malé firmy, tiskovinám pro cestovní ruch, knižní sazbě a DTP. A kromě toho „trápím“ studenty oboru informační služby a mediální komunikace, kde společně zkoumáme, co dnes vlastně znamená mediální komunikace – a jak o sobě dát vědět světu.\n💬 Když redesign webu otevře nový obor (a nikdo ho vlastně nechtěl)\nNa vlastní chybě jsem si vyzkoušela, co všechno dokáže způsobit nevinný redesign školního webu. Stačila jedna nešťastná změna ve struktuře, trocha nedorozumění, několik zmatených rodičů – a najednou jsme čelili zájmu o studijní obor, který škola sice kdysi měla, ale roky neotevřela. Přednáška ukáže, co všechno se dá pokazit – a proč to někdy vůbec nevadí.\n🧭 Chceš sa podeliť so svojím projektom na ďalšom meetupe? Ozvi sa nám, radi ťa zapojíme!",

Stojím za iniciatívou Off/Grid lab, kde pomáha galériám a múzeám tvoriť zmysluplné digitálne riešenia, ktoré robia umenie prístupným, zrozumiteľným a živým. Verím, že kultúra nemá byť tichým archívom pre vyvolených, ale priestorom pre objavovanie, zvedavosť a interakciu. Popritom vyučujem UX dizajn a výskum na univerzite, kde prepájam študentov s reálnym svetom a výzvami, ktoré majú zmysel aj dopad.\n💬 UX v galérii: príbehy pod palcom\nPodelím sa s vami o prípadovú štúdiu digitálnej aplikácie, ktorá návštevníkom umožňuje objavovať a prehlbovať vzťah k vystaveným dielam cez interaktívne funkcie. Objasním ako sme riešili výzvy s komunikáciou aplikácie priamo v priestoroch galérie a zároveň na základe používateľského výskumu identifikovali pozitívnu pridanú hodnotu, ale aj problémy s preťažením obsahu a navigáciou.\n👤 Mária Kostická – Head of Innovation Development @ Bratislava – hlavné mesto SR\nSom skúsená servis dizajnérka, ktorá už 5 rokov pomáha zlepšovať služby mesta Bratislava.

    "description": "FNURIK '25 - Festival lokálnych indie hier a hravého umenia\nHEJ TY, DUŠA NA HRANICI FORMÁTU!\nVolám na teba! Áno, teba, čo máš radšej divné než dokonalé, úprimné než uhladené, hranie než výsledok. Pozývam ťa na FNURIK – prvý ročník komunitného festivalu, kde sa môžeš stratiť a nájsť v tej istej minúte. Nájdeš tam indie hry, čo sa neboja pýtať hlúpe otázky, interaktívne výmysly, ktoré ani nevedia, že sú umenie, lokálne artsy duše s nápadmi ďaleko väčšími než ich granty, a hudbu, čo sa nehrá do uší – ale do srdca.\nČo ťa čaká:\n• Ukážky lokálnych indie hier, stolových výmyslov, VR svetov a interaktívnych experimentov, ktoré sa ťažko vysvetľujú, ale ľahko prežívajú.\n• Svižné 8-minútové prezentácie (možno aj tvojich) výtvorov• Hlasovanie ľudí, nie poroty. Kto ťa chytí za srdce, odnesie si niečo viac než len potlesk.\n• Koncerty, tetovací kútik a predstavenia, ktoré nevieš zaradiť, ale zapamätáš si ich navždy. Možno sa zasmeješ. Možno sa zamyslíš. Možno sa pretvoríš.\n• Bar, kde ťa neodsúdia ani keď si dáš len malinovku. Alko aj nealko, podľa nálady a fázy vývoja. A možno ti Kyso spraví aj čajík.\n• A hlavne – chládok v tieni javorov na jednom z najkrajších nádvorí Trnavy. Miesto, kde môžeš len tak sedieť, dívať sa, rozprávať alebo mlčať s niekým, kto ti rozumie bez toho, aby ťa musel poznať.\nTak dojdi.Zahraj sa. Pokecaj. Alebo len buď.Ticho, v kúte, so slúchadlami – aj to je forma dialógu.\nPROGRAM ZVEREJNÍME ČOSKORO :)",

    "description": "FNURIK '25 - Festival lokálnych indie hier a hravého umenia\nHEJ TY, DUŠA NA HRANICI FORMÁTU!\nVolám na teba! Áno, teba, čo máš radšej divné než dokonalé, úprimné než uhladené, hranie než výsledok. Pozývam ťa na FNURIK – prvý ročník komunitného festivalu, kde sa môžeš stratiť a nájsť v tej istej minúte. Nájdeš tam indie hry, čo sa neboja pýtať hlúpe otázky, interaktívne výmysly, ktoré ani nevedia, že sú umenie, lokálne artsy duše s nápadmi ďaleko väčšími než ich granty, a hudbu, čo sa nehrá do uší – ale do srdca.\nČo ťa čaká:\n• Ukážky lokálnych indie hier, stolových výmyslov, VR svetov a interaktívnych experimentov, ktoré sa ťažko vysvetľujú, ale ľahko prežívajú.\n• Svižné 8-minútové prezentácie (možno aj tvojich) výtvorov• Hlasovanie ľudí, nie poroty. Kto ťa chytí za srdce, odnesie si niečo viac než len potlesk.\n• Koncerty, tetovací kútik a predstavenia, ktoré nevieš zaradiť, ale zapamätáš si ich navždy. Možno sa zasmeješ. Možno sa zamyslíš. Možno sa pretvoríš.\n• Bar, kde ťa neodsúdia ani keď si dáš len malinovku. Alko aj nealko, podľa nálady a fázy vývoja. A možno ti Kyso spraví aj čajík.\n• A hlavne – chládok v tieni javorov na jednom z najkrajších nádvorí Trnavy. Miesto, kde môžeš len tak sedieť, dívať sa, rozprávať alebo mlčať s niekým, kto ti rozumie bez toho, aby ťa musel poznať.\nTak dojdi.Zahraj sa. Pokecaj. Alebo len buď.Ticho, v kúte, so slúchadlami – aj to je forma dialógu.\nPROGRAM ZVEREJNÍME ČOSKORO :)",
